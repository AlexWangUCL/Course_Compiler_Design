# Outcomes

# What is a compiler

1. from high-level language --> another language, machine language
2. source language --> target language
3. ability to extract properties of a source program and transform it to construct a target program

## source-to=source compiers
1. transpiler or transcompiler
2. typically C-to-C
3. code transformation at source level

## Java JIT Compiler
1. output .class
2. byte code

## Parallelizing compilers
## Domain-Specific Languages(DSL)
1. OpenGL shading Language
2. SQL
3. 

## interpreter
1. reads a source program and produces the resluts of executing them

# Qualities
1. correct code
2. fast code
3. conforms to the specifications of the input language
4. consistent optimizations
5. works well with the debugger
6. good diagnostics
7. compilation time proportional to the size of source
## Principles 
1. preserve the meaning of the program being compiled
2. improve the surce code in some way
3. speed of compiled code
4. space
5. feedback
6. debugging
7. compilation time efficiency
